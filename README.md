This repository contains all the plans for our studio, which we have open-sourced to make other in-school broadcasting studios easier.

All the mind maps in this repository are made in the popular Xmind program, which is free. You can download xMind to view our maps/diagrams.

## Current Maps:
Up-to-date maps and diagrams can be found in the "currentStudioPlans" folder. You will need to download xMind to view them.

## Color codes in maps:
Power Cable - Red
Ethernet Cable - Green
Audio - Blue
Video - Orange
Other Data (USB, serial, parallel, proprietary data cables, etc.) - Purple

In applicable scenarios, arrows indicate which way the data flows. This is not true of cables such as Ethernet or USB, which are bidirectional.
